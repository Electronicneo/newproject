# Owesome customers

- See https://trello.com/c/QKcx2zTN/3-simple-project-awesome-customers for futher infomations
- You have customer feature in code (this feature is made with featureCRUD schematics)
- customer model is {id :  string  , name :  string , address : string  ,  streetNumber : string  , city :  string , country : string } 
- 2 views : table mode and card mode
- 1 detail 
- 1 form for edit and add operations
- Only the table will be develop with primeNG the other thinks with Nebular(card, form , etc...)
- You have to use our architecture (facade,Container/Presentational pattern,NGRX,NGRX store,etc...)
- I suggest to install https://ngrx.io/guide/store-devtools 
- I suggest to configure @ngrx/router-store https://ngrx.io/guide/router-store
- I suggest to use 2 route
